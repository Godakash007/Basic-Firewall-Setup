# Basic-Firewall-Setup
Basic Firewall Setup Project
Abstract
The firewall setup project aims to create a basic and functional firewall that helps protect a network from unauthorized access while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through. This project focuses on configuring basic firewall rules using command-line tools like iptables (Linux) or firewalld, ensuring that both incoming and outgoing traffic is filtered according to the defined security policies. The setup enhances security by defining rules that control the flow of data between internal networks and external networks, providing protection against a range of potential attacks.
Description
